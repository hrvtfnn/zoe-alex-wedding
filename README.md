# Wedding website 💍
I created wedding site for Zoe and Alex as a school project. 🥰 <br/>
This is a simple website with the wedding's informations, like the Locations, Program list and FAQ section.

# What I learned 🪄

I learned a lot about responsibility and how sections work during the project. <br> 
It was challenging to work on responsibility and I had not worked with this many words before. I like how it turned out, but I have some plans to make it even better.🎉
